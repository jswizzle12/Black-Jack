# Black-Jack
To run our code, first start by downloading the JDK (java development kit), and JGrasp. The University of Washington's Computer Science & Engineering (UW CSE) 142/3/x support staff maintains a website for these two pieces of software. This website (https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/includesinstructions) shows how to install the JDK, jGRASP, as well as common errors students have run into when using jGRASP to write Java programs.
When you open this, the website will guide you through how to download both of the programs.Once downloaded, download the file for our code on github/bitbucket, and then open jgrasp. Click file in the top left corner, click open, and find the black jack folder, and select the solution file. 
Then, run the program, the first time won't work, but on the second run, the game will rpoperly launch.
